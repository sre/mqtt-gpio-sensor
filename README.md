mqtt-gpio-sensor
================

A service, which publishes GPIO state to a MQTT topic. The program
will drop root permissions after opening the config file and the
gpiochip device. Afterwards it will use seccomp to sandbox itself.
It is suggested to use the systemd service file for adding additional
security arrangements, such as providing a read-only filesystem or
memory limits.
